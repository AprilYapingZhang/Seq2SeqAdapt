# Seq2SeqAdapt
 We propose a novel Sequence-to-sequence Domain Adaptation Network dubbed SSDAN for robust text image recognition, which could be generalized to different scenes, such as natural scene text, handwritten text and mathematical expression recognition. The proposed SSDAN introduces a novel GAS unit in SSDAN to bridge the sequence-like text image recognition and domain adaptation, which could adaptively transfer fine-grained character-level knowledge instead of performing domain adaptation by global features. It is capable of using unsupervised sequence data to reduce domain shift effectively for robust text image recognition.
